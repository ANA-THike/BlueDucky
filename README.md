# BlueDucky
BlueDucky turns your ESP32-WROOM dev kit into a Bluetooth HID keyboard that can automatically execute commands on a Windows PC. Press a button to trigger a custom payload, while the built-in LED shows connection status. Designed for reliable typing, even on slower PCs, using a state-machine logic to ensure each step runs in order.
